## API Collection Example (Postman Example)

Example [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) API collection which supports the [Deploy Tabular Reports](https://qlik.dev/manage/reports/deploy-tabular-reports) tutorial.

> **Note:** The collection differs from the tutorial, but has logic for tests and loop processing built into some steps.

### Prerequisites
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or an alternative API collection tool such as [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/)
* The relevant input variables for the initial collection variables (these can be found in the collection definition)
